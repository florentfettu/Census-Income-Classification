# Census-Income-Classification

## Description

The goal is to solve a binary classification task to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year. The heart of the project lies in the application of the bayesian optimization of the hyperparameters of the models I've implemented.
 
 ## Scope of the project 
 
 * Exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable

I've built a mind map which summarizes my work :
